The program checks if it is running as the master process using cluster.isMaster.
If it is the master process, it forks a worker process for each CPU core using cluster.fork().
If a worker process dies, the master process creates a new worker to replace it.
Each worker process creates an HTTP server to handle incoming requests. In this example, a basic server is created that responds with "Hello, World!" for all requests.
The worker processes listen on port 3000.
The master process and worker processes communicate through inter-process communication (IPC) channels managed by the cluster module.
